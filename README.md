# VoteX

Languages/Technologies Used: PHP, SQL, jQuery, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

Made a digital system for student government elections in high school. The online system was used by students to vote and the admin section by the teachers to see the results of the voting. The system authenticated every student through an email verification system and made sure every vote was a unique one. The admin page allowed the teacher responsible for the voting with features like seeing who got the highest votes, resetting the whole system.
